# Alphabetical-Order-Trainer
Learn alphabetical orders for e.g. dictionary lookup

Given a pair of letters, use keys 1 & 2 to select whichever one comes first in an alphabet. The background changes to green and a success sound plays if it's correct; conversely red and fail sound.
Currently hard-coded with Arabic letters in the *hijāʾī* order. Other alphabets and orders are planned (to be implemented probably as custom import).
